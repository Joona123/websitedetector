# The Website Detector site
Introducing -- The Website Detector website, which will detect what website the user's currently browsing.

The only thing you need to know is you pretty much don't need to know anything, actually.

## Requirements
The HTML skills of a toddler (3 to 5 year old?) are required. You probably are older than that so you shouldn't have any problems.
